Register Members:

● Members should be able to register and be stored in the database. 

● When a member is registered, a social security number should be provided. (Regular Expression needs more work.)

● The social security number should be validated to ensure it is in the correct format. (Regular Expression needs more work; the same social security number cannot be used twice.)

● First name must not be the same as the last name.

● Only one account per member is allowed. 

● A vehicle has only one owner.
